## Crawl Friendliness

__when checking google use igncognito mode__

### Keep important content in plain HTML

* Dont use JS for content you want crawled
* Don't use images with keywords

## Use Images 

* Name images with your keyword 
* Use ALT text with keyword

** Keep your site mobile friendly

 __Google uses a mobile crawler__

 __Use a responsive site and not seperate URLS__

 ### Testing Speed

 ### Testing Mobile Friendliness

 [Google](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

 ## Crawl Budget

 __Avoid duplicate pictures__

 Use a /filter file for duplicates. Use robots.txt to avoid this folder

 ## Choosing Domains 

 * Dont use spammy on domains 
 * '-' look spammy
 * dont use .biz
 * Small boost to having keyword in the domain (not worth it)

 ## Setting up architecture 

 * Keep similar content on same sub domains
 * Keep important pages on the top level domain
 * Google assumes the deeper into directories the file it is the less important it is
 * Avoid random strings in URL
 * Use pretty url 

 ### Internal Strings

* Use simple A links
* Anchor text important
* Use descriptive anchor tags

## Key Words 

### Choosing Keywords 

* Should be relevant to your objective
* attract targeted audience 
* look into search volume 
* Check out competition
